The Problem:
	When a visitor arrives on the work page from another page on the site, the parallax doesn't work
	It does work when the visitor directly loads the work page or arrives there from another place

The Reason:
	If the user arrives the page directly, it's loaded and any javascript in the page is run
	If the user arrives on the page from another page on the site the page is not reloaded. the content is dynamically replaced
	When this happens any javascript sent with the new page IS NOT run

Solutions:
	1) Leave the javascript running as part of the page that isn't replaced - enqueue it with the other scripts
		modify the javascript to only act on mobile
